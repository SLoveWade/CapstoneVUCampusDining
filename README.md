VU Campus Dining Market Analysis

The VU Campus Dining Market Analysis was created to help give an overview of what items being created by their on-campus commissary department are selling at a greater rate than others to help increase efficiency and waste by adjusting production rates. This idea came from receiving frequent request for products that were unavailable,  which equate to missed opportunities for the business.

Technologies
- Python
- Tableau

#Challenges
Once receiving the data my biggest hurdle was being able to join the tables of shipments received, as well as marketplace sales to understand the deficit in certain market items. This was necessary in order to gauge where on-campus commissary could increase productivity. This increase would produce higher marketplace sales due to the wanted items being available. I also factored in items that did not perform well so VU Campus Dining can cut the production amounts to keep waste minimal.
